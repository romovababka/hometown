                (the end of the ancient stone age). This is the famous Cyril's parking lot, which was 
                located in the northwestern part of the city.</div>

            <div class="col-7">According to legend, at the end of the 5th - the beginning of the 6th century. 
                AD three brothers Kiy, Shchek and Khoryv and their sister Lybid founded a city on the steep 
                right bank of the Dnipro River and named it Kiev in honor of their older brother. 
                Archeological research revealed dwellings and farm buildings of the "town of Kiya" dated V-VI 
                centuries on Starokyivska Gora. The date of the foundation of Kyiv is officially accepted - 482. 
                Polyans, Drevlians, Uglichians, Severians, Tyverians united around Ancient Kyiv, 
                and the city of Kyiv became a great political center of East Slavic tribes.</div>

            <div class="col-7">In 988, Prince Volodymyr introduced Christianity as the official religion 
                in Kievan Rus. This contributed to the establishment and development of political and cultural 
                ties with the Byzantine Empire, Bulgaria and other states of Europe and the Middle East</div>

                in the Christian world. About 400 churches, 8 markets, more than 50,000 residents lived in the city.

            <div class="col-7">In the 15th century Magdeburg law was granted to Kyiv.
                Now all city affairs were managed by the magistrate. Magdeburg law gave Kyiv
                much greater independence in matters of international trade. Colonies of Greeks, Armenians,
                and Genoese appeared in the city; Turkish, Moscow, and Polish merchants had their yards.
                A market square appeared in Podil, which became the main square of the city.</div>
