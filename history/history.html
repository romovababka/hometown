                (the end of the ancient stone age). This is the famous Cyril's parking lot, which was

            <div class="col-7">According to legend, at the end of the 5th - the beginning of the 6th century. 
                AD three brothers Kiy, Shchek and Khoryv and their sister Lybid founded a city on the steep 
                right bank of the Dnipro River and named it Kiev in honor of their older brother. 
                Archeological research revealed dwellings and farm buildings of the "town of Kiya" dated V-VI 
                centuries on Starokyivska Gora. The date of the foundation of Kyiv is officially accepted - 482. 
                Polyans, Drevlians, Uglichians, Severians, Tyverians united around Ancient Kyiv, 
                and the city of Kyiv became a great political center of East Slavic tribes.</div>

            <div class="col-7">In 988, Prince Volodymyr introduced Christianity as the official religion 
                in Kievan Rus. This contributed to the establishment and development of political and cultural

            <div class="col-7">In the 15th century Magdeburg law was granted to Kyiv.
                Now all city affairs were managed by the magistrate. Magdeburg law gave Kyiv
                much greater independence in matters of international trade. Colonies of Greeks, Armenians,
                and Genoese appeared in the city; Turkish, Moscow, and Polish merchants had their yards.
                A market square appeared in Podil, which became the main square of the city.</div>

            <p class="title-history">October revolution</p>
            <div class="col-7">After the October Revolution of 1917 (the fall of tsarism), the government in Kyiv changed several times.
                Between 1917 and 1921, three governments of independent Ukraine, which was under the burden
                of the Civil War, changed in Kyiv. On January 22, 1918, the Ukrainian Central Rada, headed by
                the famous historian Professor Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, declared the independence of Ukraine.
                Soviet Russia was one of the first to recognize the independence of Ukraine.
                In 1919, the Ukrainian People's Republic headed by Simon Petliura solemnly
                united with the Western Ukrainian People's Republic. But, unfortunately, it was
                short-lived. After the defeats of the West Ukrainian and East Ukrainian armies,
                the capture of Kyiv by Soviet Russia, Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union.
                During the time of Soviet power, especially during the time of Stalin, the best
                representatives of the Ukrainian intelligentsia: scientists, writers, artists,
                engineers, soldiers - died in Gulag camps.</div>

            <div class="col-7">The Holodomor (Ukrainian: Голодомо́р, romanized: Holodomor, IPA: [ɦolodoˈmɔr]; derived from морити голодом, moryty holodom, 'to kill by starvation'), also known as the Terror-Famine or the Great Famine, was a man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. The Holodomor famine was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–1933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country.

                While scholars universally agree that the cause of the famine was man-made, whether the Holodomor constitutes a genocide remains in dispute.</div>

About 200,000 people, prisoners of war and civilians, were killed during the war. On November 6, 1943, the city was liberated.</div>
